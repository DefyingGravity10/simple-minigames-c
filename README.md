# simple-minigames-c

This is a beginner project intended to serve as a practice in using the C language. Overall, the program contains two games in total. 
Namely, these are Rock, Paper, Scissors and Tic-Tac-Toe. Due to the nature of the project, some methods utilized may not be of best practice. 
Moreover, the games implemented are purely text-based. <br/>

<br/> <b> I. Note </b> <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. All files need to be downloaded for the program to work. This is because these files are largely dependent on one another. <br/>
