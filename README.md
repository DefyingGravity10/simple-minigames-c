# simple-minigames-c

This is a beginner project intended to serve as a practice in using the C language. Overall, the program contains two games in total. 
Namely, these are Rock, Paper, Scissors and Tic-Tac-Toe. Due to the nature of the project, some methods utilized may not be of best practice. 
Moreover, the games implemented are purely text-based.
